# Feather-32u4-RFM9x-Serial-TX
This is an Arduino sketch that will take incoming data from the USB serial and send it out the RFM9x radio module.

It is a work in progress and I plan to make a few different versions. 

I pieced this together from 6+ diferent sources, which I will link below here for due thanks.

If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do to clean up this code, please comment. I am still a coding noob. Thanks!
