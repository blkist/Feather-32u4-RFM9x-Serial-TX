# Feather-32u4-RFM9x-Serial-Transceiver

This Arduino sketch will take incoming data from the USB Serial interface and send it out the RFM9x radio module, and vice versa. This is essentially a way of wirelessly sending and receiving serial data using an Adafruit LoRa Feather 32u4 board. I will also be testing this on an M0 based board, but that will happen in a few weeks. This code can be easily adapted to be used for a GPS tracker over LoRa, as well as anything else that uses serial data to communicate.

I pieced this together from 6+ diferent sources, which I will link below here for due thanks.

If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do to clean up this code or improve it, please comment. I am still a noob at coding. Thanks!
